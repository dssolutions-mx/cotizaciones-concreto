# Master Recipe Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Implementation (Safe for Deployment)

### 1. Recipe Creation Governance (Variant Control)
- **Manual Form** (`src/components/recipes/AddRecipeModal.tsx`):
  - ✅ Computes ARKIK long code and sets as canonical `recipe_code` upfront
  - ✅ Preflight detection of same-spec variants in plant
  - ✅ Modal decision: create new variant vs update existing variant
  - ✅ Code collision handling with override capability
  - ✅ Removed post-insert `arkik_long_code` updates

- **Calculator** (`src/components/calculator/ConcreteMixCalculator.tsx` + `src/lib/services/calculatorService.ts`):
  - ✅ Batch preflight modal for conflict resolution
  - ✅ Per-recipe decision: create vs update with code override
  - ✅ Sets `recipe_code` to ARKIK long; updates canonical code in DB
  - ✅ Removed `arkik_long_code` updates

### 2. Master-First Pricing with Variant Fallback
- **Validator** (`src/services/debugArkikValidator.ts`):
  - ✅ Dual-mode pricing: indexes master-level prices from `product_prices` and `quote_details`
  - ✅ Propagates master prices to all linked variants automatically
  - ✅ Fallback to variant-level pricing when `master_recipe_id` is null
  - ✅ No disruption to current operations (works with or without masters)

### 3. UI Search & Display Updates
- **ValidationTable** (`src/components/arkik/ValidationTable.tsx`):
  - ✅ Searches by `recipe_code` (canonical ARKIK) with fallback to `arkik_long_code`
  - ✅ Displays canonical `recipe_code` in results

- **RecipeList** (`src/components/recipes/RecipeList.tsx`):
  - ✅ Displays `recipe_code` as primary ARKIK code with fallback

### 4. UI-Driven Grouping Infrastructure
- **MasterRecipeGroupingInterface** (`src/components/masters/MasterRecipeGroupingInterface.tsx`):
  - ✅ **Hierarchical visual grouping:** Strength → Slump → Placement → Master Groups
  - ✅ Derives master code from recipe_code using last-two-segment suffix rule
  - ✅ Shows variant count at each level
  - ✅ Expandable tree structure for easy navigation with team
  - ✅ Execute button: creates master + links variants via RPC `link_recipes_to_master`
  - ✅ Safe operation: validates on server, fails gracefully if migrations missing
  - ✅ Color-coded levels: Blue (Strength), Green (Slump), Yellow (Placement)

- **PriceConflictResolver** (`src/components/masters/PriceConflictResolver.tsx`):
  - ✅ Loads variant prices from `product_prices` + `quote_details`
  - ✅ Resolution strategies: Most recent, Highest, Lowest, Manual
  - ✅ Writes single master-level price when applied

- **Grouping Page** (`src/app/masters/grouping/page.tsx`):
  - ✅ Hosts grouping UI
  - ✅ Available in development (no deployment needed)

### 5. Utilities & Helpers
- **masterRecipeUtils** (`src/lib/utils/masterRecipeUtils.ts`):
  - ✅ `parseMasterAndVariantFromRecipeCode()`: extracts master + variant suffix
  - ✅ Example: `5-250-2-B-07-18-B-2-PCM` → master: `5-250-2-B-07-18-B`, suffix: `2-PCM`

- **Reports** (`src/lib/supabase/reports.ts`):
  - ✅ `getVolumeByMaster()`: consolidates volumes by master (no breaking changes)

- **Feature Flags** (`src/config/featureFlags.ts`):
  - ✅ `masterGroupingEnabled`: expose grouping UI
  - ✅ `masterPricingEnabled`: toggle master-first pricing
  - Both default to false (safe)

### 6. Database Migrations (Supabase)
- ✅ Created `master_recipes` table with unique `(master_code, plant_id)`
- ✅ Added `master_recipe_id` to: `recipes`, `quote_details`, `product_prices`, `order_items`, `remisiones`
- ✅ Added `variant_suffix` to `recipes`
- ✅ Created indexes for performance
- ✅ Created RPC `link_recipes_to_master(recipe_ids[], master_id)` for safe batch linking
- ✅ Backfilled 7/9 recipes: canonicalized `recipe_code` from `arkik_long_code` (2 remain due to conflicts)

### 7. TypeScript Types
- ✅ Created `src/types/masterRecipes.ts` with `MasterRecipe` and `RecipeWithMaster` interfaces

## 🔄 Pending User-Driven Actions

### Phase 1: Recipe Grouping (Commercial + Quality Teams)
**Prerequisites:** None (infrastructure ready)

**Actions:**
1. Access `/masters/grouping` page in development
2. Review suggested groups (derived from core specs)
3. For each group:
   - Verify variants have identical specs
   - Check pricing impact (variants with different prices)
   - Click "Crear Maestro y Vincular Variantes"
   - System creates master + links variants + derives `variant_suffix`

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks (user-paced)

**Notes:**
- Start with clean groups (single price, no recent usage)
- Queue conflicting groups for Phase 2
- System remains fully operational during grouping

### Phase 2: Price Consolidation (Commercial + Accounting)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete (all recipes grouped)

**Actions:**
1. For each master with pricing conflicts:
   - Open `PriceConflictResolver` component
   - Review variant prices (dates, sources)
   - Choose strategy: Recent / Highest / Lowest / Manual
   - Apply resolution
   - System creates master-level price

**Duration:** 1 week (user-paced)

**Notes:**
- Creates quotes/approvals as needed for audit trail
- Deactivates old variant-level prices (optional)

### Phase 3: Enable Master-First Pricing
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete

**Actions:**
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_MASTER_PRICING=true` in environment
2. Deploy to production
3. Validate Arkik uploads resolve pricing from masters
4. Monitor for 1 week

**Rollback:** Set flag to `false` if issues arise

## 📋 Remaining Technical Tasks

### Database (Safe, No Disruption)
- [ ] Add `CHECK (arkik_long_code IS NULL OR arkik_long_code = recipe_code)` constraint when ready to enforce
- [ ] Backfill remaining 2 recipes with `recipe_code` conflicts (requires UI variant decision)
- [ ] Create view `v_master_recipe_summary` for reporting (from MASTER_RECIPES.md)
- [ ] Create view `v_pricing_coverage` for audit (from MASTER_RECIPES.md)

### Application (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Integrate `PriceConflictResolver` into grouping flow (embed in execute action)
- [ ] Add QuoteBuilder master selector (when `masterPricingEnabled` flag is on)
- [ ] Add bulk grouping actions (approve all clean groups)
- [ ] Add audit trail table for grouping actions
- [ ] Add telemetry/logging for variant creation decisions

### Testing (QA Phase)
- [ ] Unit tests: `parseMasterAndVariantFromRecipeCode`, same-spec detection
- [ ] Integration test: grouping flow end-to-end
- [ ] Integration test: Arkik upload with master pricing enabled
- [ ] Validation queries V1-V5 from MASTER_RECIPES.md

## 🛡️ Safety Guarantees

### Current System (Fully Operational)
✅ **Recipe Creation:** Works as before; new governance adds safety, no breaking changes  
✅ **Pricing Resolution:** Remains variant-first; master prices propagate automatically when present  
✅ **Arkik Uploads:** Match by `recipe_code`; pricing uses masters OR variants (dual-mode)  
✅ **Quotes & Orders:** Use `recipe_id` as today; `master_recipe_id` is optional  
✅ **Reports:** Work with variants; by-master reports available when masters exist  

### No Data Loss
✅ `arkik_long_code` column preserved (not dropped)  
✅ Variant-level prices remain active until manual deactivation  
✅ All indexes and foreign keys in place  

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_MASTER_PRICING=false`
2. System reverts to variant-only pricing (immediate)
3. Optionally: `UPDATE recipes SET master_recipe_id = NULL` (if needed)
