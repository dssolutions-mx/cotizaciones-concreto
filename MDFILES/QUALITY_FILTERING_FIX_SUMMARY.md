# Quality Dashboard Filtering System Fix

## Problem Identified

The quality dashboard filtering system was broken due to several issues:

1. **Incorrect Relationship Chain**: The code was trying to access `remision.order` directly, but the correct relationship is `muestreos -> remision_id -> remisiones -> order_id -> orders`
2. **Missing Dynamic Filter Population**: Filters weren't being populated dynamically based on actual data relationships
3. **Inconsistent Filtering Logic**: Filtering was scattered across multiple services with different approaches
4. **Wrong Data Structure**: The filtering logic was trying to access nested relationships that didn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Quality Filter Service (`src/services/qualityFilterService.ts`)

- **Proper Relationship Chain**: Follows the correct path: `muestreos -> remisiones -> orders -> clients`
- **Dynamic Filter Population**: Fetches actual data from the database to populate filter options
- **Centralized Logic**: All filter-related logic is now in one service
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all filter data

Key functions:
- `fetchFilterOptions()`: Main function to get all available filter options
- `getFilteredConstructionSites()`: Filters construction sites by selected client
- `validateFilterSelection()`: Validates if a selection is still valid

### 2. Updated Quality Filters Hook (`src/hooks/useQualityFilters.ts`)

- **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex, error-prone filtering logic
- **Uses New Service**: Now uses the centralized filter service
- **Better State Management**: Cleaner state management with proper validation
- **Automatic Validation**: Automatically resets invalid selections

### 3. Fixed Quality Chart Service (`src/services/qualityChartService.ts`)

- **Correct Relationships**: Updated to use proper relationship chain
- **Separate Order Fetching**: Fetches orders separately to apply client/construction site filters
- **Proper Data Flow**: Follows the correct data flow from muestreos to final chart data

### 4. Fixed Quality Metrics Service (`src/services/qualityMetricsService.ts`)

- **Consistent Filtering**: Uses the same filtering approach as chart service
- **Proper Data Processing**: Correctly processes filtered data for metrics calculation
- **Fixed Variable Conflicts**: Resolved variable naming conflicts

## Database Relationship Chain

The correct relationship chain is:

```
muestreos
├── remision_id -> remisiones
│   ├── order_id -> orders
│   │   ├── client_id -> clients
│   │   └── construction_site (text field)
│   └── recipe_id -> recipes
│       ├── recipe_code
│       └── strength_fc
└── plant_id -> plants
    ├── code
    └── name
```

## Key Changes Made

### Filter Population
- **Before**: Filters were hardcoded or populated incorrectly
- **After**: Filters are dynamically populated from actual database relationships

### Filtering Logic
- **Before**: Tried to filter through non-existent nested relationships
- **After**: Fetches related data separately and applies filters correctly

### Data Flow
- **Before**: Inconsistent data flow across different services
- **After**: Consistent data flow following the proper relationship chain

## Testing

Created a test function (`testQualityFiltering()`) to verify the filtering system works correctly. The test:
- Fetches filter options for a recent date range
- Validates that all filter types are populated
- Logs sample data for verification

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Filters**: Only shows clients, plants, recipes, and construction sites that actually exist in the data
2. **Interdependent Filtering**: All filters work together - selecting a client filters recipes, plants, and construction sites
3. **Proper Filtering**: Filters work correctly through the proper relationship chain
4. **Better Performance**: More efficient queries that follow the correct data relationships
5. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized, clean code that's easier to maintain
6. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors

## Usage

The filtering system now works as follows:

1. **Date Range Selection**: User selects a date range
2. **Dynamic Population**: Filter options are automatically populated based on data in that date range
3. **Interdependent Filtering**: All filters work together:
   - Selecting a client filters recipes, plants, and construction sites to only show those for that client
   - Selecting a plant filters clients, recipes, and construction sites to only show those for that plant
   - Selecting a recipe filters clients, plants, and construction sites to only show those using that recipe
   - And so on for all filter combinations
4. **Proper Filtering**: All filters work through the correct relationship chain
5. **Real-time Updates**: Filters update automatically when any selection changes

## Files Modified

- `src/services/qualityFilterService.ts` (new) - Main filter service with interdependent filtering
- `src/hooks/useQualityFilters.ts` (updated) - Hook with individual filter loading functions
- `src/services/qualityChartService.ts` (updated) - Chart service with proper relationship chain
- `src/services/qualityMetricsService.ts` (updated) - Metrics service with proper relationship chain
- `src/services/qualityFilterService.test.ts` (new) - Test functions for filtering system

## Key Features Added

### Interdependent Filtering
- **`fetchFilterOptionsForType()`**: New function that fetches options for a specific filter type while applying all other current selections as filters
- **Individual Filter Loading**: Each filter type (clients, recipes, plants, construction sites, ages) is loaded independently and updates when other selections change
- **Real-time Updates**: When you select a client, all other filters (recipes, plants, construction sites) automatically update to show only options available for that client

### Example Behavior
- Select "Client A" → Only recipes, plants, and construction sites used by Client A are shown
- Select "Plant 1" → Only clients, recipes, and construction sites that used Plant 1 are shown
- Select "Recipe X" → Only clients, plants, and construction sites that used Recipe X are shown

## Recent Fixes (UUID Error Resolution)

### Problem Identified
The filtering system was failing with UUID errors because:
1. **Client ID Mismatch**: The system was using client codes (like "a5f9518a") instead of proper UUIDs for client_id fields
2. **Database Relationship Issue**: The orders table was storing client codes in the client_id field instead of proper UUID references
3. **Filtering Logic Error**: The construction site filtering was trying to use client codes as UUIDs in database queries

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Client Data Fetching**: Updated the orders query to properly join with the clients table and fetch both client_id (UUID) and client_code
2. **UUID Validation**: Added proper UUID validation and fallback logic to handle both UUID and client_code formats
3. **Proper Data Mapping**: Updated all filter building functions to use the correct client_id (UUID) from the joined clients table while preserving client_code for composite keys
4. **Construction Site Fix**: Fixed construction site building to use proper client UUIDs while maintaining client_code-based composite keys

### Key Changes Made
- **`fetchOrdersWithClients()`**: Enhanced to fetch client_code from joined clients table and handle both UUID and client_code filtering
- **`buildConstructionSites()`**: Updated to use proper client UUIDs while preserving client_code for composite keys
- **`getFilteredConstructionSites()`**: Enhanced to handle both UUID and client_code filtering
- **Client Data Structure**: Updated to include both `id` (UUID) and `client_code` fields

## Latest Implementation: Cascading Filtering System

### Problem with Previous Approach
The previous implementation was trying to apply filters independently, but the user correctly identified that the filtering should work as a **cascading system** where each filter progressively narrows down the `muestreos` dataset.

### New Cascading Filtering Logic
The system now works as follows:

1. **Start with all `muestreos`** in the date range
2. **Apply plant filter** → filter `muestreos` to only those from that plant
3. **Apply recipe filter** → further filter `muestreos` to only those linked to remisiones with that recipe
4. **Apply client filter** → further filter `muestreos` to only those linked to orders from that client
5. **Apply construction site filter** → further filter `muestreos` to only those linked to orders from that client AND construction site

Each filter progressively narrows down the `muestreos` dataset, and then we extract the available options for other filters from the remaining `muestreos`.

### Key Implementation Details

#### New Function: `getFilteredMuestreos()`
- Implements the cascading filtering logic
- Progressively applies each filter to narrow down the `muestreos` dataset
- Handles the complex relationship chain: `muestreos → remisiones → orders → clients`
- Properly handles UUID vs client_code conversions

#### Updated Functions
- **`fetchFilterOptions()`**: Now uses cascading filtering to get filtered `muestreos` first
- **`fetchFilterOptionsForType()`**: Uses the same cascading logic for individual filter types
- **`fetchOrdersWithClients()`**: Simplified since filtering is now handled in the cascading logic

### Example Cascading Behavior
- **Initial state**: 1000 muestreos in date range
- **Select Plant A**: 300 muestreos remain (only from Plant A)
- **Select Recipe X**: 150 muestreos remain (only from Plant A with Recipe X)
- **Select Client B**: 50 muestreos remain (only from Plant A with Recipe X for Client B)
- **Select Construction Site C**: 20 muestreos remain (only from Plant A with Recipe X for Client B at Site C)

## Latest Fix: Dashboard Data Fetching Integration

### Problem Identified
The cascading filtering was working correctly in the filter service (showing 19 filtered muestreos and 2 available ages), but the dashboard was not showing any data points after selecting filters. This was because the dashboard's data fetching functions (`qualityMetricsService.ts` and `qualityChartService.ts`) were still using the old filtering logic instead of the new cascading filtering system.

### Solution Implemented
Updated both dashboard data fetching services to use the same cascading filtering logic:

#### Updated `qualityMetricsService.ts`
- **`fetchMetricasCalidad()`**: Now uses `getFilteredMuestreos()` with cascading filtering
- Creates proper `DateRange` and `FilterSelections` objects from the function parameters
- Uses cascading filtering to get filtered muestreos first, then fetches full data for those muestreos
- Maintains the same function signature for backward compatibility

#### Updated `qualityChartService.ts`
- **`fetchDatosGraficoResistencia()`**: Now uses `getFilteredMuestreos()` with cascading filtering
- Same approach as metrics service - cascading filtering first, then full data fetch
- Maintains the same function signature for backward compatibility

#### Exported `getFilteredMuestreos()` Function
- Made the cascading filtering function available for use by other services
- Ensures consistent filtering logic across the entire application

### Key Benefits
1. **Consistent Filtering**: Dashboard now uses the same cascading filtering logic as the filter options
2. **Proper Data Flow**: Dashboard data is now properly filtered through the cascading system
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Function signatures remain the same, so no changes needed in calling code
4. **Performance**: More efficient filtering by narrowing down muestreos first, then fetching full data

The quality dashboard filtering system is now fully functional with proper cascading filtering that progressively narrows down the `muestreos` dataset and follows the correct database relationships. The dashboard will now show data points that match the selected filters.
