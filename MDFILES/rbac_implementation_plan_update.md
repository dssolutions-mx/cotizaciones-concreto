## Implementation Examples

### Role-Protected Recipe Management

We've successfully implemented role-based access control for the recipe management feature:

1. **Recipe List Page**:
   - Added role-based conditional rendering for the "Cargar Nueva Receta" button
   - Added visual indicators to show permission status
   - Created a hasEditPermission prop to pass down to child components

2. **Recipe Details Modal**:
   - Updated the component to accept and use hasEditPermission prop
   - Protected the K2 load status toggle with RoleProtectedButton
   - Added checks to prevent unauthorized updates

### Role-Protected Price Management

We've successfully implemented role-based access control for the price management feature:

1. **MaterialPriceForm and AdminCostForm**:
   - Wrapped forms with RoleProtectedSection to restrict access based on roles
   - Only QUALITY_TEAM and EXECUTIVE can edit material prices
   - Only PLANT_MANAGER and EXECUTIVE can edit admin costs
   - Added fallback to show informative access denied messages

2. **MaterialPriceList and AdminCostList**:
   - Updated to accept hasEditPermission prop
   - Conditionally render edit buttons based on role
   - Improved UI to show cards instead of tables for better mobile experience

### Role-Protected Client Management

We've successfully implemented role-based access control for the client management feature:

1. **Client List**:
   - Added role-based conditional rendering for client actions
   - Implemented RoleProtectedButton for edit/delete actions
   - Only SALES_AGENT, PLANT_MANAGER, and EXECUTIVE can edit clients
   - Only PLANT_MANAGER and EXECUTIVE can delete clients

2. **Executive-Only Features**:
   - Added a special statistics section only visible to EXECUTIVE role
   - Used RoleProtectedSection to completely hide content from unauthorized users

### Role-Protected Quotes Management

We've successfully implemented role-based access control for the quotes management feature:

1. **Quotes Page Access**:
   - Protected the entire page with RoleGuard to restrict access to appropriate roles
   - QUALITY_TEAM cannot access the quotes section at all
   - SALES_AGENT can only see draft, create, and approved tabs
   - PLANT_MANAGER and EXECUTIVE can see all tabs including pending approval

2. **Tab-Level Protection**:
   - Dynamically generated tabs based on user role
   - Implemented proper fallbacks when no tabs are available for a role

## Reusable RBAC Components

We've created a set of reusable components that make it easy to implement role-based access control throughout the application:

### 1. RoleProtectedButton

This component renders a button only if the user has the required role(s).

```tsx
<RoleProtectedButton
  allowedRoles={['QUALITY_TEAM', 'EXECUTIVE']}
  onClick={() => editRecipe(recipe.id)}
  className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
>
  Editar Receta
</RoleProtectedButton>
```

### 2. RoleProtectedSection

This component renders its children only if the user has the required role(s).

```tsx
<RoleProtectedSection
  allowedRoles={['QUALITY_TEAM', 'EXECUTIVE']}
  action="editar precios de materiales"
>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Gestión de Precios</h2>
    {/* Price management UI here */}
  </div>
</RoleProtectedSection>
```

### 3. AccessDeniedMessage

This component displays a message when a user doesn't have permission for an action.

```tsx
<AccessDeniedMessage
  action="aprobar cotizaciones"
  requiredRoles={['PLANT_MANAGER', 'EXECUTIVE']}
/>
```

### 4. RoleIndicator

This component visually indicates whether a user has permission for an action.

```tsx
<RoleIndicator allowedRoles={['QUALITY_TEAM', 'EXECUTIVE']}>
  Editar Precios
</RoleIndicator>
```

## Role Permission Matrix

| Feature                | SALES_AGENT | QUALITY_TEAM | PLANT_MANAGER | EXECUTIVE |
|------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Access Quotes Page     | Yes         | No           | Yes           | Yes       |
| View Draft Quotes      | Own only    | No           | All           | All       |
| View Approved Quotes   | All         | No           | All           | All       |
| View Pending Quotes    | No          | No           | All           | All       |
| Create/Edit Quote      | Yes         | No           | No            | Yes       |
| Approve/Reject Quote   | No          | No           | Yes           | Yes       |
| Edit Material Prices   | No          | Yes          | No            | Yes       |
| Edit Admin Costs       | No          | No           | Yes           | Yes       |
| Manage Recipes         | No          | Yes          | No            | Yes       |
| Create/Edit Clients    | Yes         | No           | Yes           | Yes       |
| Delete Clients         | No          | No           | Yes           | Yes       |
| View Statistics        | No          | No           | No            | Yes       |

## Testing Plan

For each role, verify:

- [ ] SALES_AGENT can only see and edit their own draft quotes, but can see all approved quotes, and cannot access pending quotes
- [ ] PLANT_MANAGER can approve/reject quotes and edit administrative costs, and can see all quotes
- [ ] QUALITY_TEAM cannot access the quotes page at all
- [ ] EXECUTIVE has full access to all features

## Conclusion

The implementation of role-based access control throughout the application is now complete. We have created a consistent and intuitive user experience where users only see and interact with the features they have permission to use. The reusable components we've created make it easy to implement RBAC for new features that may be added in the future.
