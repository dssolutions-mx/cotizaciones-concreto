# 🎯 Corner Adjustment Feature

## Overview
The Corner Adjustment feature provides a revolutionary approach to document scanning by allowing users to manually adjust document corners after automatic detection. This addresses the common problem where automatic edge detection fails in challenging conditions.

## How It Works

### Traditional Flow vs. Corner Adjustment Flow

**Traditional Flow:**
```
Take Photo → Auto Edge Detection → Auto Extraction → Final Image
     ↓             ❌ Failed?         ❌ Failed?
   Done         Use Original       Use Original
```

**Corner Adjustment Flow:**
```
Take Photo → Auto Edge Detection → Manual Corner Adjustment → Extraction → Final Image
     ↓             ⚠️ Failed?              ↓
   Continue     Show Adjustment UI     Use Adjusted Corners
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Smart Workflow
- **Automatic Detection First**: Attempts automatic edge detection using advanced algorithms
- **Fallback to Manual**: If automatic detection fails, shows corner adjustment interface
- **User Control**: Users can always manually adjust detected corners

### 🎮 Interactive Corner Adjustment
- **Draggable Corners**: Click and drag colored corner markers
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview with connecting lines
- **Coordinate Display**: Shows exact coordinates for each corner
- **Auto-Detection Button**: Can trigger automatic detection from the adjustment screen

### 🔧 Advanced Options
- **Multiple Detection Modes**:
  - 🎯 **Ajuste Manual de Esquinas** (Corner Adjustment) - NEW!
  - 🔧 **Bordes Avanzados** (Advanced Edges)
  - 📊 **Detección Mejorada** (Enhanced Detection)
  - ⚡ **Forzar OpenCV** (Force OpenCV)

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Enable Corner Adjustment Mode
1. Open the scanner modal
2. Go to "Opciones Avanzadas" section
3. Check "🎯 Ajuste Manual de Esquinas (Nuevo)"
4. Click "Capturar página (ajuste manual)"

### 2. Take a Photo
- Capture a photo of your document
- The system will automatically attempt edge detection

### 3. Adjust Corners (if needed)
- If automatic detection succeeds: corners will be pre-positioned
- If automatic detection fails: corners will be at default positions
- Drag the colored circles to adjust corner positions:
  - 🔴 Red: Top-left corner
  - 🔵 Blue: Top-right corner
  - 🟢 Green: Bottom-right corner
  - 🟡 Yellow: Bottom-left corner

### 4. Confirm and Extract
- Click "Confirmar Esquinas" when satisfied
- The system will extract the document using your adjusted corners
- Quality metrics will be calculated and displayed

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **`CornerAdjustment.tsx`**: Main corner adjustment component
- **`ScannerModal.tsx`**: Enhanced with corner adjustment workflow
- **Advanced Edge Detection**: Integrated automatic detection

### Key Functions
- `handleCornerAdjustmentCapture()`: Captures image and attempts auto-detection
- `handleCornersAdjusted()`: Updates corner positions during dragging
- `handleCornerAdjustmentConfirm()`: Processes final extraction
- `handleCornerAdjustmentCancel()`: Cancels and returns to main scanner

### State Management
- `showCornerAdjustment`: Controls modal visibility
- `currentAdjustmentImage`: Stores captured image
- `detectedCorners`: Stores auto-detected corners
- `adjustedCorners`: Stores user-adjusted corners

## Benefits

### ✅ Reliability
- Works even when automatic detection fails
- Users have full control over corner positioning
- No more failed scans due to edge detection issues

### 🎛️ User Experience
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Visual feedback with connecting lines
- Real-time coordinate display
- Clear instructions and help text

### 🔄 Flexibility
- Can use automatic detection as starting point
- Can manually adjust any corners
- Can trigger auto-detection from adjustment screen
- Multiple fallback options available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Corners not detecting automatically:**
- Try different lighting conditions
- Ensure document is clearly visible
- Use "Detectar Automáticamente" button in adjustment screen

**Corners hard to position accurately:**
- Zoom in on the image if possible
- Use coordinate display for precise positioning
- Take a new photo if current one is unclear

**Document extraction fails:**
- Ensure corners form a reasonable quadrilateral
- Check that corners are in correct order (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left)
- Verify corners are not too close together

### Performance Tips

- Use good lighting for better automatic detection
- Keep document steady when taking photo
- Adjust corners carefully for best extraction results
- Use debug mode to see detection confidence scores

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Pinch-to-zoom on adjustment canvas
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Corner snapping to detected edges
- [ ] Batch processing of multiple pages
- [ ] Export/import corner configurations

### Integration Opportunities
- [ ] Mobile app support
- [ ] Integration with OCR systems
- [ ] Template-based corner positioning
- [ ] AI-powered corner suggestions

## Technical Notes

### Scaling Considerations
- Corners are scaled from adjustment canvas (400x300) to original image dimensions
- Scaling factors are calculated dynamically based on image size
- Coordinate transformation ensures accuracy

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if automatic detection fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery options for failed extractions

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Minimal re-renders during dragging
- Optimized image processing pipeline
